          <h2>Hydrogen vs Methane Hybrid Rocket Torch Igniter</h2>
          <p class="project-entry-p">
            In this project, my main goal was to characterize the performance of a Nylon-6/Gaseous Oxygen Hybrid rocket for varying igniter input parameters. This included the type of igniter fuel used such as Hydrogen or Methane, and the flow rates of these fuels. The process for achieving this goal consisted of: conducting a literature review to understand the current state of hybrid rocket igniter technology; designing and manufacturing test hardware such as the rocket nozzle; designing and building the test rig to hold the rocket, the data acquisition system and program from scratch using Arduino, the piping system to feed the oxygen and igniter fuels to the rocket, and the...

          <h2>Data Acquisition and Valve Control System</h2>
          <p class="project-entry-p">
            This project came as a blessing in disguise, with its inception rooted in a major administrative setback in my Hydrogen vs Methane hybrid rocket torch igniter project. About one year working into that project, our lab received the news that we would be moving to another facility across town. This move deprived us using our pre-installed data acquisition and controls circuits. In order to move the hybrid rocket project along, I decided to use Arduino to design and build from scratch the data acquisition and valve control system rather than waiting for the electrical system in the new lab to be up and running. This experience truly tested...

          <h2>REALOP CubeSat Systems Engineering</h2>
          <p class="project-entry-p">
            In my final year of my undergraduate studies and after spending two years working on the REALOP CubeSat mission, I had the opportunity to lead the entire project as the chief systems engineer. As part of my responsibilities I oversaw the technical development in all systems of the cubesat including the attitude determination and controls, structures, software, and electrical systems. I also authored technical requirements, implementing decomposition and traceability of these requirements flowing down from high level spacecraft requirements down to lower level subsystem and component requirements. I then used these requirements to...

          <h2>CubeSat Structure Design and Development</h2>
          <p class="project-entry-p">
            In this project, I lead a team of 15-20 engineers in designing a structure for a 2U cubesat. The project started from nothing, with the REALOP mission being the first cubesat made by undergraduate students at UC Davis. Having no heritage designs to go off of, we relied on influences from other student teams and companies such as PolySat from Cal Poly SLO and the cubesat kit from Pumpkin Inc. I decided to divide the structures team into three smaller subdivisions to focus on main structure design, integrating internal components, and verifying design feasibility through structural analysis. While I played a major management role in this team, I also...

          <h2>Hard Disk Drive Reaction Wheel</h2>
          <p class="project-entry-p">
            My first year with Space and Satellite Systems at UC Davis brought me the unique opportunity to work on the early stages of the hard disk drive (HDD) reaction wheel (RW) project. An initial study we conducted of the RW market found that 1.8 to 3.5 inch HDDs would provide similar angular momentum storage for a small fraction of the cost of industry-standard RWs. With these findings, we began to run simulations to evaluate performance metrics such as the torque and power consumption while working on used HDDss to control the angular velocity. The main goal of this project was to raise the technological readiness level of HDDs as reaction wheels.
