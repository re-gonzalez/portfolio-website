            	This project came as a blessing in disguise, with its inception rooted in a major administrative setback in my Hydrogen vs Methane hybrid rocket torch igniter project. About one year working into that project, our lab received the news that we would be moving to another facility across town. This move deprived us using our pre-installed data acquisition and controls circuits. In order to move the hybrid rocket project along, I decided to use Arduino to design and build from scratch the data acquisition and valve control system rather than waiting for the electrical system in the new lab to be up and running. This experience truly tested my resilience and allowed my adaptability and creativity to shine. In doing this project, I learned a lot about embedded systems design, testing, signal processing. I have this project to thank for my significantly improved troubleshooting and system diagnosis skills.

							The data acquisition circuit used an Arduino Uno microcontroller board to read the analog voltage outputs from the two gas flow meters, one pressure transducer, and one compression load cell. The output of the two gas flow meters were 0-5V analogue signals that scale linearly with the measured flow rate. The Arduino Uno’s analogue input pins were capable of measuring analogue signals in this range with 8-bit precision so, as shown in the circuit schematic to the left, the flow meters were connected to two of the Arduino’s analogue input pins, denoted as ’A1’ and ’A3’. A 12V DC adapter plug was used to power the flow meters

						<p class="project-content-p">
							The output for the pressure transducer and load cell were 0-30mV and 0-20mV respectively, so in order to amplify the output signals, increase resolution, and reduce noise, an AdaFruit ADS 1115 analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) was used to process the signals before being read by the Arduino processor. The pressure transducer and load cell were each powered by a 10V DC adapter plug. The ADC was powered by the 5V power output of the Arduino board and used the same internal clock as well. The serial clock and serial data lines between the ADC and Arduino boards were connected via the ‘SCL’ and ‘SDA’ pins. The digital pin on the Arduino board labeled ‘D2’ was connected to the Arduino board used for valve timing and control. Finally, the Arduino board was connected to the main computer via a USB-A to printer cable to carry the digital data. The open-source serial communication interfacing program PuTTY was then used to log the transducer data from the Arduino, which was pre-programmed to send the data in comma-separated value format (CSV).

							The solenoid valve timing and actuation used a separate Arduino Uno board. The reason for using a different Arduino board was because when both the data acquisition and valve timing and actuation programs were uploaded to the same board, the processes carried out by the latter program would interfere with the timing of the data acquisition sampling rate. When both programs were separated into different boards, the timing issues were resolved. The solenoid valves used run on 120V AC. The valves were accordingly powered by connecting to a standard 120V AC wall outlet plug. The circuit between the wall plug and each valve was open at a solid state relay. The other side of the solid state relay received direct current signals up to 5V , so one lead was connected to a digital output pin on the Arduino board, and the other lead was connected to ground. The digital pins were then programmed to output a high signal and therefore close the relay on the AC voltage side and thus turn on and open the solenoid valve, at specific points in time.

							Two additional digital pins were set as input pins and used to add manual operation capabilities. Each pin was tied to ground via a resistor and connected to the 5V supply across a switch. The first feature added was an emergency stop switch (E-Stop). When digital pin ‘D2’ was shorted to the 5V input (closing the E-Stop) switch, the high signal would cause the program to immediately cut any valve actuation signals coming from the output digital pins (‘D11’, ‘D12’, and ‘D13’), thereby closing all valves. Shortly after, a signal would be sent to open the nitrogen valve. This way, all propellants would stop flowing into the combustion chamber and Nitrogen would flow into the combustion chamber to stop the combustion and quench any remaining flames. The second feature added was manual operation of the Nitrogen-line solenoid valve. When the N2 Control Switch was closed, the 5V signal into digital pin ‘D3’ would cause the program to send a signal to open the Nitrogen valve. The valve could then be closed by opening the switch. This feature was only enabled when the program entered a “stand-by” mode. The program would enter the stand-by mode only after normal operation of the static firing sequence finished, or the E-Stop switch had been activated. Finally, the digital pin ‘D5’ on this board was programmed as an output and connected to the digital pin ‘D2’ of the data acquisition board. Shortly before the ignition event, the output pin would be set to high. This high signal would then be read by the digital pin on the instrumentation circuit Arduino board and trigger the microprocessor to start recording data. Both Arduino boards were also connected to the same ground to ensure the correct voltage potential was being written and read by both boards.
