# portfolio-website
Hi! My name is Ricardo Gonzalez and this is the repository for my portfolio website.

Apart from presenting my engineering experience, projects, and skills, this website also showcases my web development skills.
About one month before starting this repository, I decided to pick up front-end web development as a hobby. To help me practice
what I've learned and solidify my skills, I began creating this hard-coded static website as my first web development project.
