						Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Ricardo Gonzalez and I am an aspiring aerospace engineer driven by opportunities to learn and motivated by seeing progess. I graduated from UC Davis with a two Bachelor's degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering as well as a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering. During my time as an undergraduate I was heavily involved in spacecraft design by taking part in and leading the REALOP CubeSat project. I am pictured on the left, just moments before a preliminary design review presentation during my time as the lead structures engineer. As a graduate student I joined the Energy Research Lab and conducted research on Hydrogen use in Hybrid Rocket propulsion.
					</p>
					<p>
						Taking from my experience, my fields of interest are propulsion, controls systems with an emphasis on spacecraft attitude determination and control systems, and systems engineering. I also have a personal interest in embedded systems and software development.
