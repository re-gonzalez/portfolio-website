            	In this project, I lead a team of 15-20 engineers in designing a structure for a 2U cubesat. The project started from nothing, with the REALOP mission being the first cubesat made by undergraduate students at UC Davis. Having no heritage designs to go off of, we relied on influences from other student teams and companies such as PolySat from Cal Poly SLO and the cubesat kit from Pumpkin Inc. I decided to divide the structures team into three smaller subdivisions to focus on main structure design, integrating internal components, and verifying design feasibility through structural analysis. While I played a major management role in this team, I also made many contributions to ensure we created a modular, manufacturable, and cost-effective structure that could survive the harsh environment of the launch into space and the thermal environment once in orbit.

							The image to the left is the final result of the main structure design subdivision. The first step of coming up with this design was to lay out a list of requirements and specifications that the structure should meet. Some of these requirements came from internal decisions such as being made to be modular and adaptable to be able to hold any type of payload. Other requirements came from external organizations such as NanoRacks as they were the deployment provider. As such the cubesat needed to be able to fit, within tolerance, into the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer, have clean surfaces free of holes or mounted components on the rails, and provide space for deployment switches that would power on the cubesat once it was deployed. The payload userâ€™s guide for the Antares rocket from Northrop Grumman defined the launch environment which provided the structural loading requirements. The structure was designed to distribute the physical loads as well as anticipated thermal loads from the orbital environment while maximizing the amount of surface area for mounting the payload and other components and minimizing the total mass of the structure. All CAD modeling and part drawings were made using SolidWorks.

							The experimental setup consisted of the rocket assembly mounted on a rigid truss structure and the piping and instrumentation connecting the compressed gas tanks to the injector block of the rocket. Although some parts of the rocket had been previously designed, I designed the nozzle using the expected mass flow rates and operating chamber pressure. The cross section drawing of the nozzle is shown in the figure on the far right. I also prepared the solid Nylon-6 fuel grains using a lathe and a drill press, working with tolerances on the order of 5 thousandths of an inch to ensure a proper sealed fit in the combustion chamber. I constructed the truss structure from aluminum L-brackets and tested the thrust-bearing member with a static load of four times the expected thrust. After taking inventory of the equipment and hardware available in the lab I drew up a piping and instrumentation diagram (left figure), listing every piece of hardware to assemble the system.
