            	In my final year of my undergraduate studies and after spending two years working on the REALOP CubeSat mission, I had the opportunity to lead the entire project as the chief systems engineer. As part of my responsibilities I oversaw the technical development in all systems of the cubesat including the attitude determination and controls, structures, software, and electrical systems. I also authored technical requirements, implementing decomposition and traceability of these requirements flowing down from high level spacecraft requirements down to lower level subsystem and component requirements. I then used these requirements to help me create a verification and validation plan. Other responsibilities I had were to create the mission’s concept of operations, assess technical and non-technical risks to the mission, create mass, power, and link budgets, and assist in overall technical development wherever needed. I also took the liberty to create a database of technical document templates for the teams to use such as verification procedures, interface and control documents, and more. A major influence of my work in this project came from the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook.

							One of my responsibilities in this project was to create the mission’s concept of operations (con ops). The image to the left shows a simplified diagram of an early draft of the con ops. Starting from deployment, the cubesat would power on the electrical systems and deploy the antenna. Before moving on to other tasks, the main computer would verify successful deployment of the antenna. After this, the cubesat would cycle between an idle mode while handling background processes and one of the three main modes. Part of this mission was a technology demonstration of hard disk drives as reaction wheels, so one of the three main modes was the hard disk drive experiment mode where the attitude would be controlled with the hard disk drive reaction wheel while recording the telemetry data. Another main mode was an imaging mode using the hard disk drive to point and stabilize the camera. The third main mode was also an imaging mode but this time using a conventional reaction wheel. This way the quality of the images taken during the two different imaging modes could be compared. Finally, one of the background processes was to check predetermined health state monitors. These health state monitors consisted of voltage and temperature measurements of vital components. The estimated battery charge and reaction wheel speeds were also included.

							The experimental setup consisted of the rocket assembly mounted on a rigid truss structure and the piping and instrumentation connecting the compressed gas tanks to the injector block of the rocket. Although some parts of the rocket had been previously designed, I designed the nozzle using the expected mass flow rates and operating chamber pressure. The cross section drawing of the nozzle is shown in the figure on the far right. I also prepared the solid Nylon-6 fuel grains using a lathe and a drill press, working with tolerances on the order of 5 thousandths of an inch to ensure a proper sealed fit in the combustion chamber. I constructed the truss structure from aluminum L-brackets and tested the thrust-bearing member with a static load of four times the expected thrust. After taking inventory of the equipment and hardware available in the lab I drew up a piping and instrumentation diagram (left figure), listing every piece of hardware to assemble the system.

							A vital component of this project was documenting and constantly updating the mass, power, and link budgets for the spacecraft. The budgets were also used to potentially revise requirements definitions and inform design decisions. For example, the mass budget (as shown to the left) was used to make sure the spacecraft mass never exceeded the maximum mass allowed set by the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer requirements. More detailed subsystem level mass budgets were also created and used. These mass budgets helped to plan where to allocate mass for components and inform decisions such as structural members’ wall thicknesses, the reaction wheel’s thickness and radius, etc.

						<p class="project-content-p">
							The power consumption of the various PCBs, cameras, sensors, attitude control actuators, and other components were documented and compared with the power generation capabilities from the solar panels and the power storage in the batteries. This way, requirements for surface area of solar panels or power consumption by actuators could be more well-informed. Finally, a link budget was created to analyze and decide on image file sizes (decompression) and telemetry data packages based on time available in orbit for down linking to ground stations and down link speed.
